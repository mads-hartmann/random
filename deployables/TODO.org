#+STARTUP: indent
I'm basing my things very much on [[https://realpython.com/blog/python/dockerizing-flask-with-compose-and-machine-from-localhost-to-the-cloud/][this article]].

* Next steps
** TODO Postgres
*** TODO How to facilitate integration testing
Create a python Messages module that can store and fetch messages. Create a small
integration test for it that stores and fetches a message
** TODO How to deal with venv not being exposed to editor?
Perhaps you need to install it separately? That feels a bit clunky
** TODO Linting?
** TODO Logging
Just docker-machine logs? (the new docker-compose file has a logging key under services)
** TODO Error reporting
** TODO Performance measuring
