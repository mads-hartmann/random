# Reading Keyboard Input

This is an experiment. The main problem I'm trying to figure out is how to get
Emacs running inside of iTerm to send the same control keys that I'm used to
when running the proper GUI version of Emacs on OS X.

One example: Ctrl+. work in GUI Emacs but not in iTerm.
TODO: Investigate why, figure out how I can get iTerm to send some kind of input
to Emacs that I can react to. I have a feeling that one solution might be to get iTerm
to send a sequence that I've defined and then add a mapping for that in Emacs.
