# Electron ðŸ’¬ Docker

This is a proof-of-concept for a tiny electron app that talks to Docker over a
socket.

    npm install
    npm run start

To be precise the electron app starts a small express server that talks to
Docker over a socket -- the electron app then talks that server. This is not
strictly needed (see previous commits in this folder) but as this is a
proof-of-concept for something we're build at Famly it made sense in our case.
